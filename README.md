# GAfinalProject

This is my final project for General Assembly. 

I'm a product designer working in fin-tech so I chose to do a portfolio site for the things I've done in my work experience. I have a few pages on the site, but I only have 3 active as an MVP. You can see the Retirement App, About Me, and the homepage index. Using HTML I built the structure, using CSS I've styled it and created hover effects, and Javascript for the hamburger menu. 

As a stretch goal I want to include the other pages and a contact form. I would also like to explore doing a Gmail integration as part of a contact form.
